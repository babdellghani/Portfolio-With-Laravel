### 2. Controller Updates

Updated the following controllers to send notifications:

-   `Admin\BlogController` - Added notifications for blog creation and updates
-   `Admin\CategoryController` - Added notifications for category creation and updates

### 3. Header Notifications

Enhanced the admin header notification dropdown to display:

-   Different icons and colors for each notification type
-   User registration notifications
-   Blog/Comment/Category/Tag creation and update notifications
-   Contact message notifications
-   Time stamps for all notifications

### 4. Sidebar Count Badges

Updated the left sidebar to show count badges for:

-   **Blog Posts**: Shows pending drafts from non-admin users (warning badge) or total count (info badge)
-   **Categories**: Shows pending categories from non-admin users (warning badge) or total count (secondary badge)
-   **Tags**: Shows pending tags from non-admin users (warning badge) or total count (secondary badge)
-   **Comments**: Shows pending comments (warning badge) or total count (info badge)

## Notification Types and Icons

| Notification Type | Icon                     | Color            | Action                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| User Registration | `ri-user-add-line`       | Success (Green)  | Redirects to Users Index      |
| Blog Created      | `ri-article-line`        | Info (Blue)      | Redirects to Blogs Index      |

## How It Works

### For Regular Users:

1. When a regular user creates/updates any content, a notification is sent to all admin users
2. The sidebar shows their personal counts for their own content
3. Pending items are marked with warning badges

### For Admin Users:

1. Admins receive notifications for all content created/updated by regular users
2. Admins don't receive notifications for their own actions
3. The sidebar shows system-wide counts with special handling for pending items
4. The notification dropdown shows all recent activities with appropriate icons and colors

## Database Storage

All notifications are stored in the `notifications` table using Laravel's built-in notification system. Each notification includes:

-   Type of action (blog_created, comment_updated, etc.)
-   User information (ID, name)
-   Content information (title, excerpt, etc.)
-   Action URL for quick navigation
-   Timestamp

## User Experience

-   Admins get real-time visual feedback about user activities
-   Easy navigation to relevant admin pages
-   Clear visual distinction between different types of notifications
-   Count badges help admins quickly identify areas needing attention
-   Notifications can be marked as read individually or in bulk

## Future Enhancements

This system can be easily extended to include:

-   Email notifications for critical actions
-   Real-time notifications using WebSockets
-   Notification preferences for different admin roles
-   Mobile push notifications
-   Scheduled digest emails
